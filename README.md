# vuejs-simple-crud
The basic idea from this project was (but not limited to) the basic understanding of Vue.js components and general use of the fraemwork, however, since i've started learning Vue.js , i was very intrigued in how i can i use Vuex for state management for a simple, but not so simple example, i've decided to use Vuex for an interesting animation state management of some of the DOM elements in my app, let me know what you think. This is my first Vue.js project, and i'm loving it! 
## Tools used
* Vuex
* Vue-router
* [GSAP](https://greensock.com/) for animations
* [Material design icons](https://gitlab.com/robcresswell/vue-material-design-icons)
* Fake data, real API endpoints used: [reqres](https://reqres.in/)  and [jsonplaceholder](https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/)
* CSS basic animations
## Currently working on
* Animation state management for home route DOM elements
## Roadmap
* API data visualization component
* API data edition component
* PWA proper dev (Basic scaffolding for now)
