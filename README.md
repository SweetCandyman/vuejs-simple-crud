# vuejs-simple-crud

The basic idea from this project was (but not limited to) the basic understanding of Vue.js components and general use of the fraemwork, however, since i've started learning Vue.js , i was very intrigued in how i can i use Vuex for state management for a simple, but not so simple example, i've decided to use Vuex for an interesting animation of some of the DOM elements in my app, let me know what you think.
